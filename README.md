# Portfolio
Below is the depoyable link for my portfolio as well as a screen recording of its functionality

I'm not going to lie, I struggled with this assisgnment a little bit. I still am unsure of how to link my deployable link for my refactor code assignment into the picture to open it when clicked on. 

Besides that and some styling things I think I got the gist of the accpetance criteria, which seemed to be flexboxes/flex, advancded CSS styling, pseudo effects, and media queries.

# Acceptance Critera for this assignment:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
